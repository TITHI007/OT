Practical 2- SCILAB Basic Commands


//3X3 MATRIX
A=[1 2 3; 
   4 5 6; 
   7 8 9]

//TRANSPOSE OF A
B=A'

//ADDING 2 MATRIX
C=A+B

//SUBSTRACTING A MATRIX FROM ANOTHER
D=B-A

//MULTIPLICATION OF MATRIX
E=A*B // MUST BE COMPATIBLE 3X3 MATRIX*3X3 MATRIX HENCE WE GET 3X3 MATRIX 

//INVERSE OF A MATRIX
F= [3 1 2;
   1 5 3;
   2 3 6]
G= inv (F)

//MULTIPLYING F AND ITS INVERSE WE GET IDENTITY
H=F*G

//DETERMINANT OF F
det(F)

//Matrix of log of each element of A.
log(A)

//MULTIPLYING ELEMENTS BY ELEMENTS
A.*B
A^2 //multiplying the same matrix to itself
A.^2// MULTIPLYING ELEMENTS BY ELEMENTS
A=zeros(2,5)
B=ones(6,5)
C=eye(4,4)
C=10*eye(4,4)
diag(F)
diag(F,-1)
//(F,-2) gives 2 as answer
d=4
C=eye(d,d)*d
